cargo new [name of the directory]

Go into the hello_cargo directory and list the files. You’ll see that Cargo has generated two files and one directory for us: a Cargo.toml file and a src directory with a main.rs file inside.

It has also initialized a new Git repository along with a .gitignore file. Git files won’t be generated if you run cargo new within an existing Git repository; you can override this behavior by using cargo new --vcs=git.

cargo init will create a Cargo.toml

cargo build creates an executable file in target/debug/hello_cargo

cargo run to compile the code and then run the resultant executable all in one command 

cargo check this command quickly checks your code to make sure it compiles but doesn’t produce an executable


We can create a project using cargo new.
We can build a project using cargo build.
We can build and run a project in one step using cargo run.
We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using cargo check.
Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the target/debug directory.

cargo build --release to compile it with optimizations it will create an exe target/release instead of target/debug
